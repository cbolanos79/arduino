Just another LCD HD44780 based sketch for arduino.
=======================================
 
This sketch is intented for reduced learning purposes and reducing
memory consumption so may be usable on a tiny45/tiny85 uC
Instead using classes and library use a procedures and preprocessor directives
  
##Typical LCD pinout:
*    1 VSS
*    2 VCC
*    3 VEE
*    4 RS
*    5 R/W // Connect to ground
*    6 E
*    7 DB0
*    8 DB1
*    9 DB2
*   10 DB3 // DB0 - DB3 are not used on 4 bits mode
*   11 DB4
*   12 DB5 
*   13 DB6
*   14 DB7
*   15 LED+ // May vary
*   16 LED- // May vary
 
###8 bits mode
Just place this line on the code

    #define LCD_8BITS

**Remember: there must be only one mode defined**

###4 bits mode
Just place this line on the code

    #define LCD_4BITS

**Remember: there must be only one mode defined**

Latched mode
--------------------
  There are two modes available: 8 bits and 4 bits
  You should use always 4 bits mode unless you have any good reason (8 bits mode require two shift registers).
###8 bits
  *Must use two chained shift registers: first one for data bus and second one for Enable and RS signals*
  
Place this line on the code to enable the latched mode:

    #define LATCHED

Shift registers pinout

*    First shift register
    *    DS -> Arduino LATCH_DATA
    *    SHCP -> Arduino LATCH_CLOCK
    *    STCP -> Arduino LATCH_LATCH
    *    VCC -> +5V
    *    GND -> GND
    *    MR -> +5V
    *    OE -> GND
    *    Q0 -> D0
    *    Q1 -> D1
    *    Q2 -> D2
    *    Q3 -> D3
    *    Q4 -> D4
    *    Q5 -> D5
    *    Q6 -> D6
    *    Q7 -> D7
    *    Q7S -> second shift register DS input
       
*    Second shift register
    *    DS -> First shift register Q7S output
    *    SHCP -> Arduino LATCH_CLOCK
    *    STCP -> Arduino LATCH_LATCH
    *    VCC -> +5V
    *    GND -> GND
    *    MR -> +5V
    *    OE -> GND     
    *    Q0 -> RS
    *    Q1 -> Enable

###4 bits
  *Must use only one latch
  
Place this line on the code to enable the latched mode:

    #define LATCHED

*    Shift register
    *    DS -> Arduino LATCH_DATA
    *    SHCP -> Arduino LATCH_CLOCK
    *    STCP -> Arduino LATCH_LATCH
    *    VCC -> +5V
    *    GND -> GND
    *    MR -> +5V
    *    OE -> GND
    *    Q0 -> D4
    *    Q1 -> D5
    *    Q2 -> D6
    *    Q3 -> D7
    *    Q4 -> RS
    *    Q5 -> ENABLE
    *    Q6 -> Not used
    *    Q7 -> Not used
    *    Q7S -> Not used
       
#TODO
   - Add support to drive LCD using MCP23017/MCP23008 (reduces pinout consumption, more expensive but allow reading inputs) on both 8 bits and 4 bits mode 
   - Write a library instead a sketch
 
#CHANGELOG
*    v0.1 Initial release supporting basic 8 bits mode and major instruction set except for custom character generator
*    v0.2 Support for 4 bits mode
*    v0.3 Added functions to display on/off, cursor on/off, blink cursor on/off. 
    *    Fixed error using clear_display()
    *    Clear display on init()
*    v0.4 Support for 8 bits mode latched (595 shift register)
*    v0.41 Support for 4 bits mode latched (595 shift register)
